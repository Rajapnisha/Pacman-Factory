# Pacman Factory

This project demonstrates an interactive **Pacman Factory**, where Pac-Men are dynamically created and move across the screen. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be used as a fun simulation to showcase object creation and movement within a web page.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pac-Man Creation**: Pac-Men are generated dynamically on the screen with a simple click.
- **Smooth Animation**: Pac-Men move across the screen smoothly, simulating the classic arcade game's movement.
- **Collision Detection**: The Pac-Men change direction upon hitting the edges of the screen, making the animation more interactive.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the game elements.
- **CSS3** for styling and animation effects.
- **JavaScript** for controlling the creation of Pac-Men, their movement, and collision logic.
